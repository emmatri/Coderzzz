  <h1>Exercise</h1>

<p>There is strong evidence demonstrating the benefit of exercise on your
 mental health. The release of endorphins can boost mood, energy levels and
reduce stress. So why not give it a go?</p>

<p>You do no need to run a marathon to make the most of exercise. Virtually any
form of exercise, from aerobics to yoga, can act as a stress reliever. It can be
as simple as a gentle walk or stretches. Discover the connection between
exercise and stress relief - see below for more ideas and tips!</p>

  <h1>YOGA</h1>

<p>Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility
and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing.Many studies have found
that a little yoga in the morning, at night, or even on a lunch break, can
minimise stress and increase productivity. It is believed that yoga is so
effective for stress relief because, aside from the physical benefits that
yoga brings, it encourages a good mood, an increase in mindfulness, and a
healthy dose of self-compassion. Give the poses below a try!</p>

  <h2>CHILD'S POSE</h2>

<img src="childs-pose.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="300" height="300">

<p>Child's Pose is perfect for when you've had a long, exhausting day and you
just want to get comfy and curl up in a ball. This resting position can be held
for as short as 30 seconds up to several minutes â€” depending on how long it
takes you to relax into the posture and get fully comfortable.
It can relieve back and neck pain when the head and torso are supported, calm
the brain, and assist in the reduction of stress and fatigue.
Close your eyes, breathe, and let all that stress go.</p>

  <h2>CAT AND COW POSE</h2>

<img src="Cat-Cow-Pose.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="300" height="300">

<p> Inhale, lift the heart, the head and the tailbone; exhale and draw in the
belly as you lift the spine toward the sky; let the head and tailbone drop,
releasing the spine and getting all kinds of lovely space in there.
Keep going, following the breath, five times or until you feel ready to
move on.</p>

  <h2>DOWNWARD DOG</h2>

<img src="madelyn-downdog.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="400" height="300">

<p>The downward dog is the great for blood flow. Tuck the toes and on an exhale,
come up into downward-facing dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana). Pedal the feet here,
stretching the calves, hamstrings, and just letting the back decompress.</p>

<div id="exercise_2">

  <h1>High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h1>

<p>HIIT is great for blood flow and creates a real rush of endorphins. It
can be as short as 10 minutes to have a real effect. Try the workout below:
  <ul>
      <li>3 min fast walk warm up </li>
      <li>30 seconds sprint</li>
      <li>30 seconds walk x 3</li>
      <li>3 min fast walk cool down</li>
  </ul>
