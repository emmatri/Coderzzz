  <h1 > Mindfulness </h1>

<p id=info_1 class="lead">It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much.

Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings,
and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Studies show that
practising mindfulness can help to manage depression, some
  anxiety problems and feelings of stress. Some structured mindfulness-based
  therapies have also been developed to treat these problems more formally.</p>

<p id=info_1 class="lead">Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we
  are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going
  on around us. While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it’s more
  readily available to us when we practice on a daily basis.

  Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing via your senses,
  or to your state of mind via your thoughts and emotions, you’re being mindful. And
  there’s growing research showing that when you train your brain to be mindful,
  you’re actually remodeling the physical structure of your brain.</p>

  <h1> Getting started with Mindfulness </h1>
  <img src="mindfull.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="1000" height="500">
<br>
<p id=info_1 class="lead">Mindfulness helps us put some space between ourselves and our
  reactions, breaking down our conditioned responses. Here’s how
  to tune into mindfulness throughout the day: <br>
  <ul class="lead">
  <li><strong>Set a side some time.</strong> You don’t need a meditation cushion or bench, or
  any sort of special equipment to access your mindfulness skills—but you do
  need to set aside some time and space.<br></li>

  <li><strong>Observe the present moment as it is.</strong> The aim of mindfulness is not quieting
  the mind, or attempting to achieve a state of eternal calm. The goal is simple:
  we’re aiming to pay attention to the present moment, without judgment. Easier
  said than done, we know.<br></li>

  <li><strong>Let your judgments roll by.</strong> When we notice judgments arise during our
  practice, we can make a mental note of them, and let them pass.<br></li>

  <li><strong>Return to observing the present moment as it is.</strong> Our minds often get
  carried away in thought. That’s why mindfulness is the practice of returning,
  again and again, to the present moment.<br></li>

  <li><strong>Be kind to your wandering mind.</strong> Don’t judge yourself for whatever thoughts
  crop up, just practice recognizing when your mind has wandered off, and gently
  bring it back</li>
</ul>
