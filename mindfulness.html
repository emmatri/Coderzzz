  <h1 > Mindfulness </h1>

<p id=info_1 class="lead">It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much.

Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings,
and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Studies show that
practising mindfulness can help to manage depression, some
  anxiety problems and feelings of stress. Some structured mindfulness-based
  therapies have also been developed to treat these problems more formally.</p>

<p id=info_1 class="lead">Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we
  are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going
  on around us. While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it’s more
  readily available to us when we practice on a daily basis.

  Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing via your senses,
  or to your state of mind via your thoughts and emotions, you’re being mindful. And
  there’s growing research showing that when you train your brain to be mindful,
  you’re actually remodeling the physical structure of your brain.</p>

  <h1> Getting started with Mindfulness </h1>
  <img src="mindfull.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="1000" height="500">
<br>
<p id=info_1 class="lead">Mindfulness helps us put some space between ourselves and our
  reactions, breaking down our conditioned responses. Here’s how
  to tune into mindfulness throughout the day: <br>
  <ul class="lead">
  <li><em>Set a side some time.</em> You don’t need a meditation cushion or bench, or
  any sort of special equipment to access your mindfulness skills—but you do
  need to set aside some time and space.<br></li>

  <li><em>Observe the present moment as it is.</em> The aim of mindfulness is not quieting
  the mind, or attempting to achieve a state of eternal calm. The goal is simple:
  we’re aiming to pay attention to the present moment, without judgment. Easier
  said than done, we know.<br></li>

  <li><em>Let your judgments roll by.</em> When we notice judgments arise during our
  practice, we can make a mental note of them, and let them pass.<br></li>

  <li><em>Return to observing the present moment as it is.</em> Our minds often get
  carried away in thought. That’s why mindfulness is the practice of returning,
  again and again, to the present moment.<br></li>

  <li><em>Be kind to your wandering mind.</em> Don’t judge yourself for whatever thoughts
  crop up, just practice recognizing when your mind has wandered off, and gently
  bring it back</li>
</ul>

  <h1> Mediatation for Beginners: 5 Easy Steps </h1>
  <p id=info_1 class="lead"> Interested in beginning meditation but don't know where to
    start?<br><br> Here are a few easy techniques to get you started.

The basic tenets of meditation — relaxation and breathing — can be difficult to master
in our hectic lives, but if you're able to find just a few minutes a day, that's all you
need to get started.<br><br>

Benefits of meditation include stress reduction, sharpened concentration, and improved
circulation to start. Once you begin to practice, you'll soon experience a quieter mind,
 a more open heart, and a sense of inner freedom. </p>
 <ol class="lead">
 <li><b>Be comfortable in a quiet place</b>
   <br>
  Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. To get started, it doesn't matter
   whether you sit or lay down as long as you are comfortable. You can sit cross-legged,
    on the floor, or on a chair. If you can sit erect, then great. If not, it's just
    important to have your body in a somewhat stable position. Then have the palms of
     your hands face the sky.<br></li>
     <li><b>Become "present."</b>
       <br>
      Become totally aware of your current surroundings. What do you hear? How does
      it feel to sit? Do you feel tension? Where are your thoughts?<br></li>
         <li><b>Focus on your breath</b>
           <br>
          As you take long and deep breaths, feel your breath move from your lungs
          and out through your nostrils or your throat. (Breathing through your nostrils
           is better though either will work). Your mind will wonder (which is okay),
            just try your best to be as focused as possible.<br></li>
             <li><b>Feel your body</b>
               <br>
              Once you're focused, take notice of your body and how each body part
              feels. Start with the toes and work your way up to your head. If your
               mind continues to wonder then bring your thoughts back to your breath.
                Breath 5 to 10 times with full concentration on each breath. Take it
                 a step further and hum "Om" as you breathe out.<br></li>
                 <li><b>Practice, practice, practice!</b>
                   <br>
                  Like anything, practice makes perfect. Make sure to carve out a
                  time each and every day to practice. You'll hopefully find all
                  your practice totally worth it as meditation can be life-changing!<br></li>
