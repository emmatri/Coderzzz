<p>It's no secret that a balanced diet is beneficial for your physical well
    being, but did you know that eating well can improve your mental health too?<p>

<p>In fact, diet is such an important component of mental health that it has
  inspired an entire field of medicine, called nutritional psychiatry.</p>

<p>Hundreds of scientific studies have been published that support the link
  between what we eat, and our risk of depression.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of fruit, vegetables,
    whole grain, fish, olive oil, low-fat dairy and antioxidants and low intakes
    of animal foods was apparently associated with a decreased risk of depression.
    A dietary pattern characterized by a high consumption of red and/or processed
    meat, refined grains, sweets, high-fat dairy products, butter, potatoes and
    high-fat gravy, and low intakes of fruits and vegetables is associated with an
    increased risk of depression.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's therefore vitally important that we take care of diet to reduce stress,
  feel physically well and reduce the risk of depression. Here are some recipes
  you could try out that are easy, cheap, student-friendly, and most of all
  healthy!</p>
